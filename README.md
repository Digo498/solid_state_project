Proposed Exercise

Calculate vibration frequencies and the set of displacements for a 1D chain of 100 and 1000 bodies of mass = 1kg, joined by equal springs of k = 1 kg/s²

a) Density of states for w²
b) Present a plot with the set of displacements for the first and the last frequencies. The body number would be in the x-axis, and the relative displacement relative to each body on the y-axis. Use  dots/symbols joined by lines on the plot. Specify the frequency of each plot.
